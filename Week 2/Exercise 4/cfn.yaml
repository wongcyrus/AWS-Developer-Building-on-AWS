Description: 'AWS CloudFormation Sample Template IAM_Users_Groups_and_Policies: Sample
    template showing how to create IAM users, groups and policies. It creates a single
    user that is a member of a users group and an admin group. The groups each have
    different IAM policies associated with them. Note: This example also creates an
    AWSAccessKeyId/AWSSecretKey pair associated with the new user. The example is somewhat
    contrived since it creates all of the users and groups, typically you would be creating
    policies, users and/or groups that contain referemces to existing users or groups
    in your environment. Note that you will need to specify the CAPABILITY_IAM flag
    when you create the stack to allow this template to execute. You can do this through
    the AWS management console by clicking on the check box acknowledging that you understand
    this template creates IAM resources or by specifying the CAPABILITY_IAM flag to
    the cfn-create-stack command line tool or CreateStack API call. '
